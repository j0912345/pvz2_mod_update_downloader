# what is it?
2 python scripts that download an obb from a google drive file, then upload that file to nox using NoxConsole.exe,  
a program that is automatically installed with nox it's self     

this can be useful for updating the obbs of beta testers with less effort than manually updating.  
(you can change the file that it downloads in settings.json)

# running
what you need to do to run:  
  
install python3.10+  
run ``` pip install gdown``` in a terminal    
to read and edit the settings.json file  

# notes:
make sure that nox is running ***BEFORE*** you run the script.  
you need python 3, ***not 2!***
